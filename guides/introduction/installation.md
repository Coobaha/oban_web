# Installation

Oban Web is delivered as a hex package named `oban_web`, which is published privately to our
self-hosted package repository. The package is entirely self containedâ€”it doesn't hook into your
asset pipeline at all.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure Oban is installed for your application. It's probably there already, but just in case,
   follow [these instructions][oi] to get started.

2. Ensure [Phoenix Live View][plv] is installed and working in your application. If you don't have
   Live View, follow [these instructions][lvi] to get started.

## Authentication

Before you can pull the package into your application you need to add a new `oban` hex repo.
First, grab the `OBAN_KEY_FINGERPRINT` and `OBAN_LICENSE_KEY` from your account page.

Then, run the following `mix hex.repo` command:

```console
mix hex.repo add oban https://getoban.pro/repo \
  --fetch-public-key $OBAN_KEY_FINGERPRINT \
  --auth-key $OBAN_LICENSE_KEY
```

#### Authenticating Other Systems

You'll also need to authenticate on any other development machines, build servers and CI/CD
instances. There are also guides to help with building [Docker Images][do], authenticating on
[Gigalixir][gi] and [Heroku][he].

## Configuration

Now that you're authenticated you're ready to add `oban_web` as a dependency for your application.
Open `mix.exs` and add the following line:

```elixir
{:oban_web, "~> 2.10", repo: "oban"}
```

Now fetch your dependencies:

```console
$ mix deps.get
```

This will fetch both `oban_web` and `oban_met`, if you haven't already installed `oban_met`
through `oban_pro`.

After fetching the package you'll use the `Oban.Web.Router` to mount the dashboard within your
application's `router.ex`:

```elixir
# lib/my_app_web/router.ex
use MyAppWeb, :router

import Oban.Web.Router

...

scope "/" do
  pipe_through :browser

  oban_dashboard "/oban"
end
```

Here we're using `"/oban"` as the mount point, but it can be anywhere you like. See the
`Oban.Web.Router` docs for additional options.

After you've verified that the dashboard is loading you'll probably want to restrict access to the
dashboard via authentication, e.g. with [Basic Auth][ba].

#### Switch to the PG Notifier

PubSub notifications are essential to Web's operation. Oban uses a Postgres based notifier for
PubSub by default. That notifier is convenient when getting started, but it has a hard restriction
on payload size.

To get the most out of Web's metrics, you should switch to the PG (Process Groups) based notifier
built on Distributed Erlang.

```elixir
config :my_app, Oban,
  notifier: Oban.Notifiers.PG,
  repo: MyApp.Repo,
  ...
```

The PG notifier **requires that your app is clustered** together. Otherwise, notifications are
local to the current node.

#### Usage in Worker Only Nodes

To receive metrics from non-web nodes in a system with separate "web" and "worker" applications
you must explicitly include `oban_met` as a dependency for "workers".

```elixir
{:oban_met, "~> 0.1", repo: :oban}
```

## Customization

Web customization is done through the `Oban.Web.Resolver` behaviour. To allows you to enable
access controls, control formatting, and provide query limits for filtering and searching. Using a
custom resolver is entirely optional, but you should familiarize yourself with the default
limits and functionality.

Installation is complete and you're all set! Start your Phoenix server, point your browser to
where you mounted Oban and start monitoring your jobs.

## Next Steps

* Configure the dashboard connection or mount additional dashboards with the `Oban.Web.Router`

* Configure dashboard behavior with access controls, query limits, and formtting with
  `Oban.Web.Resolver`

* Attach logging and hook into telemetry events with `Oban.Web.Telemetry`
