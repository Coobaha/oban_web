## [Unreleased]

## Changes

- Add support for explicitly disabling stats rather than inferring based on
  queue configuration. This prevents issues in production environments where
  certain nodes (i.e. web) aren't processing any queues, but the the UI is
  accessed.

  ObanWeb configuration now differs from Oban configuration and you'll need to
  specify it separately. Specify the `repo` in `config.exs`:

  ```elixir
  config :my_app, ObanWeb, repo: MyApp.Repo
  ```

  Disable the stats tracker in the test environment:

  ```elixir
  config :my_app, ObanWeb, stats: false
  ```

## [v0.6.1] 2019-11-22

## Fixes

- Ignore the stats server when queues is empty.
